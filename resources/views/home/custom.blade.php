        <hr>
        <p>We like to start our custom orders out by having a consultation with you. This canbe done in person, over the phone, or via email. We want to work with you first hand to bring your design ideas to life. Our customers are always welcome to show us referencepictures to help guide us in the right direction</p>

        <p>Once the idea is in place, one of our professionals will begin building a 3D model of your design. Our certified CAD designers will ensure that your piece turns out as it was discussed in your consultation. Once completed, we will send you renders of your jewelry from multiple angles, allowing you to see exactly what the finished model will look like.
        </p>

<br />
We know that this process may be unfamiliar to many of our customers and are committed to providing the highest levels of service, consideration and care.

        <p>As soon as you approve the renders we’ve sent you, we will print a 3d model of your piece. This 3d model will then be cast into the metal of your choosing. We use top of the line equipment to ensure your casting comes out perfectly.
